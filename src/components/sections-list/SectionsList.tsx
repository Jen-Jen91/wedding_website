        <p className="main-text">
          We met at university and started dating a few months into our first
          year in 2011.
        </p>
        <p className="main-text">
          After graduating in 2014, we went our own ways (but stayed together)!
          Tomek moved to Cambridge to get a degree in Law, while Jen worked in
          London before taking a year to travel solo in Australia.
        </p>
        <p className="main-text">
          We came back together and back to London at the start of 2017. It was
          exciting to start building our lives together in our first flat and
          re-exploring the city we met in as students.
        </p>
        <p className="main-text">
          We decided to take a leap and move to Edinburgh in mid-2018, and we
          haven't looked back. Jen also took the chance to change careers and
          become a software developer, with Tomek following suit a few years
          later.
        </p>
        <p className="main-text">
          2020 brought chaos and uncertainty for everyone. Although the year had
          a few big hardships, it brought us closer together and Jen realised
          there was no-one else she'd rather to go through it all with. She
          proposed to Tomek in June at our favourite spot on the Water of Leith.
        </p>
        <p className="main-text">
          We bought our very own place in 2021 in Leith, our favourite part of
          Edinburgh, and finally booked our wedding venue.
        </p>
        <p className="main-text">
          After more than 10 years together, we're so excited to start our next
          chapter and can't wait to see you all soon!

          Cambo is a traditional country house in Fife, a short drive from St

          of the house with shared bathrooms, a living area, and a small kitchen
          where you can prepare any breakfast / lunch / tea / coffee. Some
          guests will be set up in the private cottages separate from the main
          house, situated at the edge of the grounds by the main road. Everyone
          is free to explore the house and make use of any living areas,
          bathrooms, and games rooms.
